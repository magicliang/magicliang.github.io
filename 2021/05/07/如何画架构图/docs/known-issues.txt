If Archi does not load and shows an error dialog
------------------------------------------------

When trying to launch Archi you may see a dialog box stating "An error has occurred." 

If this happens you need to delete the ".config" folder and restart Archi.

- On Windows, the ".config" folder is located at "<user>/AppData/Roaming/Archi4/.config"
- On Mac, the ".config" folder is located at "<user>/Library/Application Support/Archi4/.config"
- On Linux, the ".config" folder is located at "<user>/.archi4/.config"

On Mac, this folder will be hidden in the Finder so you need to show hidden files and be able to see the "Library" folder.
